## Overview

Welcome to the Ziv programming language project! Ziv is designed to combine the best features of various programming languages while maintaining simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to create a language that is not only powerful but also accessible to developers of all backgrounds.

> **Note**: Ziv is still in its early stages of development. We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring you a powerful and user-friendly programming language.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Built on LLVM for optimized native code generation
- 🛡️ **Memory Safety**: Strong compile-time guarantees without runtime overhead
- 📦 **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with predictable performance
- 🔧 **Modern Tooling**: Integrated build system and package management
- 📚 **Rich Standard Library**: Comprehensive built-in functionality
- 🌟 **Clear Syntax**: Familiar, expressive, and readable code

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.20+
- LLVM 19.0+
- Python 3.8+ (for development tools)

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites**

- Install Mambaforge from: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge

- Install conda-lock:

    ```bash
    mamba install conda-lock
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ziv-language/ziv.git
    cd ziv
    ```

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
    ```bash
    # Create reproducible environment
    conda-lock install --mamba -n ziv conda-lock.yml
    conda activate ziv
    ```

4. **Build the Project**
    ```bash
    cmake -G Ninja -B build -S .
    cmake --build build
    ```

5. **Verify Installation**
